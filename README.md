# Classification-Data-analysis-and-visualization
Support Vector Machines are an excellent tool for classification, novelty detection, and regression. ksvm supports the well known C-svc, nu-svc, (classification) one-class-svc (novelty) eps-svr, nu-svr (regression) formulations along with native multi-class classification formulations and the bound-constraint SVM formulations. ksvm also supports class-probabilities output and confidence intervals for regression.
# in R, use ksvm

Performs k-nearest neighbor classification of a test set using a training set. For each row of the test set, the k nearest training set vectors (according to Minkowski distance) are found, and the classification is done via the maximum of summed kernel densities. In addition even ordinal and continuous variables can be predicted.
# in R, use kknn
